# ExpenseTracker
I'm building an expense tracker app with a chart showing monthly spending. Dragging over it reveals daily totals. Below, the five latest transactions show merchant, category, date, and amount, with icons from SwiftUIFontIcon. Clicking "See All" shows all transactions by month. The app supports dark mode and focuses on accurate financial data.
